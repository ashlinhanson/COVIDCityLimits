# Motivation 
Due to the Coronavirus pandemic that changed the world as we knew it. Losing Austin's live music scene is a tremendous loss to the city that is known as "The Live Music Capital of the World". Our project is created to bring a little of that lost live music festival feel, if only for a moment, back into your life. So grab your group, make your Flag and hoist it up high, pick your Headliners and Artist and watch your performance.

# Usage Instructions

* Enter your performer in the Artist Name input box
* Select Add a Headliner or Artist, when one is selected a modal will open and if there is a live  concert scheduled for the near future, the venue information will show up in a modal. In the bottom of the modal a "remove artist" button is added in case you want to delete the selection.
* When Start My Festival is selected the music video populates
